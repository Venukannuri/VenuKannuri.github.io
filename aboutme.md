Mission-driven full stack developer with a passion for thoughtful AI design, collaboration, and teaching.âœ¨ focus working in the Calgary area. The love of building things led to the love of programming. I like finding multiple unique solutions to challenging problems.

I believe in moving fast and that perfect is the enemy of good. Move forward, build cool stuff without fear.

I care about code quality, maintainability, and readability.

I am language and framework agnostic but currently heavily working with React, Redux, Vue.js, Python and Java.
